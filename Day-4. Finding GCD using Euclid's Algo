GCD of two numbers
SchoolAccuracy: 51.03%Submissions: 29148Points: 0
Given two positive integers A and B, find GCD of A and B.


Example 1:

Input: A = 3, B = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: GCD of 3 and 6 is 3

Example 2:

Input: A = 1, B = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: GCD of 1 and 1 is 1

Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function gcd() which takes two positive integers as input parameters and returns an integer.


Expected Time Complexity: O(log(min(A, B)))
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 109






//drivers code 

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
/*
gcd of (a,b) is nothing but gcd(b,a%b);
*/
int gcd(int a, int b){
    if(b == 0)
        return a;
    gcd(b,a%b);
}

int main(){

    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    cout << gcd(a,b) << endl;

    return 0;
}
